Product from master thesis at The Master Program in Smart Healthcare Management of National Taipei University (Taiwan). The product uses open data (BreakHis Dataset), so the classification results still need further consultation from specialists before using.
The aim of this application is to diagnose between benign and malignant from histopathological images.
The models available in this software are: mixed, 40x, 100x, 200x and 400x. The model you want to use depends on the magnification of the image you want to classify.
